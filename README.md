This repo contains my notes on the coding exercises from [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/)'s [Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

In addition to sharpening my JavaScript skills, I am approaching this course with the intention of developing my pseudo coding practice and creating excellent documentation.

## Working With Arrays

INDEX NOTES
Array indexes begin at 0 (the first item in an array is indexed zero)

### Simple Array Methods

- #### SLICE

  Slice is an array method that takes in up to two parameters that represent array item indexes and returns a new array made up of the items including the item at the first index parameter up until (not including) the end parameter.

  The new array is a shallow copy of the specified parameters, slice does not mutate the original array.

### The new at Method

- The at method works similarly to bracket notation in that it will return an array item based on the index number passed into the method.
- The at method allows for negative indexing, to count back from the end of an array, the last item indexing at -1
- The at method allows for method chaining
- The at method can also be used on strings
