This repo contains my work on the coding exercises from [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/)'s [Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

In addition to sharpening my JavaScript skills, I am approaching this course with the intention of developing my pseudo coding practice and creating excellent documentation.
